ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to Skeleton Shopify Theme! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the Skeleton Shopify Theme project. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Code of Conduct
Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Please refer to our Code of Conduct for complete details.

## Getting Started
Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A GitHub account.
- Familiarity with [Git commands](https://git-scm.com/doc).
- Read the Shopify theme development [documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes).

## How Can I Contribute?
Contributions can take many forms, from writing documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code that can be incorporated into Skeleton Shopify Theme itself. Below are some guidelines.

### Reporting Bugs
Before creating bug reports, please check the issue tracker as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible by filling out the provided template.

### Suggesting Enhancements
Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's maintainers of the merits of this feature.

### Your First Code Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing to Skeleton Shopify Theme? You can start by looking through 'beginner' and 'help-wanted' issues:
- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/dear-digital/shopify-theme-skeleton/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/dear-digital/shopify-theme-skeleton/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than 'beginner' issues.

### Pull Requests
- Fill in the required template.
- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title.
- Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
- Follow the [Shopify Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and [CSS BEM](http://getbem.com/) coding style.

## Styleguides
### Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### JavaScript Styleguide
- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting.
- Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.
- Include descriptive comments where necessary.

### CSS Styleguide
- Use BEM methodology for naming and organizing.
